A theme based heavily off of the aesthetics of the Lancer TTRPG, and Santi Younger's Wasp theme.
This theme is an edited version of the theme "Powered by Lancer" by Dion McMillan, made to fit my preferences for the dark theme, changing colours to be more pleasing to the eyes, while still sticking with the theme and usage of colours that would ordinarily be seen within the Lancer TTRPG.
